# Customer Segmentation Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on customer segmentation using unsupervised learning techniques. The goal is to analyze customer data and identify distinct segments that can help in targeted marketing strategies and improving customer engagement.

## Model Approach

1. **Data Preparation**: The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values and encode categorical variables.

2. **Feature Selection**: Relevant features such as total transactions, recency, frequency, and coupon usage were selected for clustering.

3. **Clustering**: K-Means clustering was implemented to group customers into segments. Various values of 'k' were tested to determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method.

4. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to visualize clusters in a 2D space.

5. **Cluster Evaluation**: Different clustering metrics were calculated to assess the quality of the clusters:
   - **Silhouette Score**: Measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters.
   - **Davies-Bouldin Index**: Evaluates the average similarity ratio of each cluster with its most similar cluster.
   - **Calinski-Harabasz Index**: Measures the ratio of the sum of between-cluster dispersion to within-cluster dispersion.

## Evaluation Metrics

| Number of Clusters | Silhouette Score | Davies-Bouldin Index | Calinski-Harabasz Index |
|---------------------|------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| 2                   | 0.2819           | 1.3130                | [Your value]             |
| 3                   | 0.2195           | 1.6676                | [Your value]             |
| 4                   | 0.2055           | 1.4681                | [Your value]             |
| 5                   | 0.1962           | 1.3922                | [Your value]             |

## Key Findings

- The optimal number of clusters based on evaluation metrics was determined. The cluster summary provides insights into customer behavior across different segments.
- Recommendations were formulated for each segment based on average transaction behavior, coupon usage, and frequency of purchases.

## Conclusion

The customer segmentation analysis allows businesses to tailor their marketing strategies effectively. By understanding distinct customer segments, organizations can enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty.

## Usage

To run the project, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed (e.g., pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib). Execute the Python script to perform clustering and generate visualizations.
